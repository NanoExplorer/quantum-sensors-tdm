Files in executable_scripts should be placed within /usr/local/bin/ 
Change the owner to the main user with chown and make them executable with chmod.

Example, lets say you want to be able to acquire noise data by issuing a single command within a bash shell.
The file noise_quicklook has commands to do this.  Do the following

sudo cp noise_quicklook /usr/local/bin/noise_quicklook
sudo chown pcuser:pcuser /usr/local/bin/noise_quicklook
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/noise_quicklook

Then from anywhere within a bash shell, try noise_quicklook --help.
You should be able to see with the command call options are.
